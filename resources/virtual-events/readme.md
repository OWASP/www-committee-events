### Virtual Meeting activity - How To Run One For Your OWASP Chapter

The easiest way to run a virtual meeting activity is by using Zoom.

OWASP Foundation provides Zoom Pro Accounts for OWASP Chapter Leaders. Unlike free Zoom which many of us might already have, Zoom Pro provides 30-hour non-stop meetings and Live Streaming on YouTube (free Zoom accounts are usually limited to 40 minute meetings and no live-streaming).


You need to request a Zoom account by raising a 'Shared Services' ticket in JIRA:Click on [Contact Us](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)

You will receive credentials for a Leaders Zoom account: a username which looks like this: "leaders-zoom-x@owasp.org" and the password will be sent out separately (do check your Spam folder!).

A recommended way to run the event is to schedule a Zoom meeting and invite just your chapter co-leaders and the speakers to the Zoom session, however the audience will watch the event on YouTube. This avoids some well-known problems with Zoom such as 'Zoom bombing' and also allows you to extend your reach. An event which is being live-streamed on YouTube can get a much wider world-wide audience potentially reaching thousands or even tens of thousands of viewers. 
Another advantage is that after your event is over YouTube will keep the recording of the event at the same URL it was live-streamed on.

Should you wish to edit the meeting recording and publish individual talks as separate videos on your channel - you can do that by downloading the recording from the Zoom Pro Cloud account (YouTube will also create a downloadable video recording of the event stream inside your YouTube channel / YouTube Studio some 24 hours after the end of the event)

The YouTube audience can ask questions using the Q&A panel on YouTube however for anonymous questions you could use something like sli.do website (you can simply signup/login to sli.do using your owasp.org Google account) 

### How To Create a YouTube Channel For Your OWASP Chapter

To create a YouTube channel for your Chapter make sure you are logged in to your OWASP Gmail account first and then follow the steps here:

https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1646861

^This will create a YouTube channel using your name e.g. 'John Smith' . It will be associated with your owasp.org email account.

Then follow the steps in the same Google Support article article for:
"Create a channel with a business or other name " - use these steps to create a channel for a brand "OWASP YourChapter".

Then you should be able to add your Chapter co-leaders as Channel Managers using Settings/Account/Channel Managers menu (they will need to have an owasp.org or mail account).

### How To Live Stream your Zoom Meeting activity on YouTube

1. Make sure you have a YouTube Channel and that it is enabled for Live-Streaming (usually you need to verify your YouTube account using an SMS message) - please visit: https://youtube.com/verify and https://youtube.com/features to check if your account is verified and live-streaming is enabled. Try the Live STream button and ensure that the privacy of the default live stream is set to "Public" (if you set it to "Unlisted" or "Private" then the streaming from Zoom will fail).
2. Make sure that the meeting attendees are given your YouTube Channel URL(e.g. In Meetup/mailing list/social media) and your speakers/panelists/co-leaders have been sent the Zoom Meeting invite.
3. Log In to your YouTube account
4. Start your Zoom Meeting 10-15 minutes before the scheduled time of your event - make sure your speakers join the Zoom session as well and that they all have tested their audio/video and screen sharing with you
5. Remember to right-click on your speakers names in Zoom and make them co-hosts of the Zoom session, so they could share their screens during their talks/presentations
6. When you are ready to go Live click on More/"..." menu in Zoom and select "Live On YouTube"
7. On the next screen specify the name of your event as you want it to appear on YouTube Live on your YouTube Channel
8. Click the "Go Live!" button
9. That's it - your Chapter meeting is now LIVE ON YOUTUBE!

### Preparing A Scheduled YouTube Live Stream

YouTube has a great feature where you can schedule a Live-stream in advance. You can set up a placeholder thumbnail image for the show, the stream date & time and YouTube will place a "Set Reminder" button on the video allowing potential viewers to set a reminder and be notified when the stream goes live. Scheduled live-stream also allows you to publish the live-stream URL in advance.

In order to use this feature you need to configure the scheduled stream inside YouTube Studio and copy the Stream Key and Stream URL. Inside Zoom you will need to use "Custom Live Streaming Service" and paste the values of the Stream Key, Stream URL and the Live Stream URL (YouTube video URL of the live-stream). 

#### During The Meeting

1. Watch out for and collect questions in the Q&A YouTube panel and Sli.Do Q&A if you are also using Sli.do for anonymous questions
2. Copy-paste the questions from the audience into the Zoom Chat, so your Speakers could access the questions

#### Ending The Meeting

When you click on "End Event For All" button in Zoom the live-streaming will stop and the recording will be available in the Zoom Cloud (inside Zoom website there is a Recording Menu when you are signed in).

YouTube will also keep the recording of the Live Stream under the "Live" tab of your YouTube channel and approximately after 24 hours the recording will also become available under the Videos tab. As a YouTube channel administrator you will be able to download the stream recording from YouTube as well (24 hours after the event end). Note that Zoom recording contains the recording of your Zoom session from the start of your Zoom meeting, however the YouTube recording will have the recording from the moment you clicked the "Go LIVE on YouTube" button. 



## Zoom Alternatives

Many Chapters have been running their virtual meetings using platforms such as *StreamYard* and *JITSI* which both provide Live Streaming to YouTube in their free plans, however you do need to be aware of their participant and streaming limits. StreamYard limits free use to 20 hours per month and Jitsi limits YouTube Live-Streaming to 60 minutes on their free plan. Both embed their logos watermark into the streams. Please note that as of March 2021 Zoom is the only virtual platform officially provided by the OWASP Foundation to OWASP Chapters.
